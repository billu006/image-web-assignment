    <h2>Far cry 6</h2>
    <p><img src="../image/Far.Cry.6-16675449200402.jpg" alt="Far Cry 6" align="left" />Far Cry 6 takes place in 2021 in Yara, a fictional Caribbean island nation inspired by Cuba and ruled by the dictator Ant贸n Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito).
        A 1967 guerrilla revolution that toppled the presidency of his father 
       led to Yara's isolation from the rest of the world. Since then, the 
       country's economy has approached the brink of collapse. In 2014, Ant贸n 
       is elected president and oversees the creation of Viviro, a new cancer 
       treatment developed from Yara's tobacco, promising it will make the 
       economy stable. Seven years after being elected, Ant贸n announces a draft
        "lottery" to conscript citizens as farmers in the tobacco fields. Ant贸n
        has a 13-year-old son, Diego (Anthony Gonzalez), whom he grooms to be his successor.	</p><hr />
