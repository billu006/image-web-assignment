      />In near future Oregon, the Freaker Virus has decimated the globe,
      turning a large portion of humanity into violent zombies. Outlaw bikers
      Deacon St. John (Sam Witwer) and William "Boozer" Gray (Jim Pirri),
      alongside Deacon's wife Sarah Whitaker (Courtnee Draper) attempt to flee
      to safety, and manage to find a helicopter run by the National Emergency
      Restoration Organization (NERO), with room for two more. While Sarah
      boards the helicopter, critically injured from a stab wound, Deacon
      decides to stay behind with Boozer. He promises to reunite with his wife.
